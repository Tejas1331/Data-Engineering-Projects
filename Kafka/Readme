Data Pipeline: SQL to Kafka to JSON Project Overview

This project implements a data pipeline that starts with data generation and insertion into an SQL database. A producer script is then used to read the data from the SQL database and send it to a Kafka cluster. Subsequently, a consumer script processes the data from Kafka, transforms it into JSON format, and stores it in a JSON file.
